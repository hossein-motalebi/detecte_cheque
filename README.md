Handwritten Cheque Analyzer
Description
This Handwritten Cheque Analyzer is a collaborative project developed at the University of Grenoble, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to interpret handwritten dates and amounts on cheques. Utilizing both supervised and unsupervised learning methods trained on the MNIST dataset, this tool aims to automate and streamline the process of cheque processing in financial institutions.

Features
Handwritten Text Recognition: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to accurately read handwritten dates and amounts from cheques.
Advanced Image Processing: Employs techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for image feature extraction.
Robust Machine Learning Integration: Combines various machine learning models, including neural networks and k-nearest neighbors, for effective learning and prediction.
MNIST Dataset Training: Leverages the MNIST dataset to enhance the model's accuracy and reliability in recognizing handwritten characters.
Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed and then install the necessary dependencies:

pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-image scikit-learn

Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, execute the main script from the terminal:

bash
Copy code
python main.py <input_cheque_image_path>
Replace <input_cheque_image_path> with the path to the cheque image you want to analyze.
